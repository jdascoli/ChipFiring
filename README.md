# ChipFiring
 I had an opportunity Winter 2024 to attend a mathematics talk at UWM with Caroline Klivans, who talked about her research into the mathematics of chipfiring. After watching her talk and seeing the brilliant visuals made from the math, I wanted to create a program to recreate it myself. Chipfiring is just the way a pile forms when a large quantity of them are dropped, like grains of sand or poker chips.
